# Student-Registry-Simulator
The program should compile, it works in terminal, vscode and netbeans.
I started writing the code in netbeans then transitioned to vscode.
I also tested in terminal, the program does use ansi escape codes to colour the courses
in the schedule, this may not work if you are not using a ide.
When you hit run the code should automatically run the commands given in inputs.txt.
There are also 2 other text files; students and courses, both of these are also read from.
While testing the code would sometimes mess up formatting the schedule, this problem usually
went away by rerunning the code without making any changes, the reason for this is unknown
so if you encounter this problem just rerun the code and it should be ok.
